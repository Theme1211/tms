Ex1
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between numbers x and y (both included). Return list of this numbers.
Use list comprehension.

Ex2
With a given number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is number 
between 1 and n (both included). The program returns the dictionary. Use dict comprehension.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

Ex5
Given a phrase, count the occurrences of each word in that phrase and return result as a dictionary where key is a word 
and value is a count the occurrences.

For example for the input "olly olly in come free"

olly: 2
in: 1
come: 1
free: 1

Convert a phrase to its acronym.

Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!

Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).
